              <br>

              <h3>3.1 Service Providers</h3>
              <br>

              <p>We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</p>
              <br>

              <h3>3.2 Legal Disclosures</h3>
              <br>

              <p>It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of ABC Learning Center, our students, personnel or others. We attempt to notify students about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.</p>

              <h2>4. Your Choices & Obligations</h2>
              <br>

              <h3>4.1 Data Retention</h3>
              <br>

              <p>We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services.</p>
              <br>

              <h3>4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data</h3>
              <br>

              <p>We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you.</p>
              <br><br>

              <h4>For personal data that we have about you, you can:</h>
              <br><br>

              <h4>Delete Data:<h4><p>You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Change or Correct Data:</h4><p>You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.
              </p>
              <br>

              <h3>4.3 Account Closure</h3>
              <br>

              <p>If you choose to close your account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
              <br><br>    
              We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Professional Community Policies), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
              <br><br>
              Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.</p>
